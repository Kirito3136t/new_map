This project introduces a comprehensive pothole detection and mapping system that utilizes accelerometers, GPS modules, and the advanced YOLOv8 algorithm for real-time identification of road anomalies. Going beyond conventional methods, the system seamlessly integrates with Google Maps, providing users with not only pothole visualization along their routes but also offering alternate paths to avoid areas with a high pothole count, thereby enhancing overall travel safety. Emergency services benefit from optimized routes based on real-time pothole data, ensuring swift response times. The YOLOv8 algorithm, in conjunction with webcams, enhances detection accuracy. Integrated with a traffic hawaldar application, the system correlates pothole data with accidents, providing officials with valuable insights for targeted interventions. A comprehensive dashboard empowers road maintenance officials with real-time pothole status, efficient data management, and proactive notifications, facilitating timely interventions and contributing to a substantial improvement in overall road quality and safety.
